## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2018-02-23
### Added
- Ability to set `token_type` in configuration and pass this into `FaradayMiddleware::OAuth2` to avoid `faraday_middleware` 0.11.0 warning about using the default token type. Set `token_type: 'bearer'` to only pass the oauth token as an Authorization header instead of both a header and query string parameter.
- This CHANGELOG.
